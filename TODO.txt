- Cubeload the work area
	- make class with ITicket
	- add that ticket to cube
- preload the next layer
	- 1 tick generation
	- 1 tick population
- store in (vanilla's) chunkcache

	actually if you want to prepopulate 17x17 area
	you need to generate 19x3x19 cubes

Shad0wlifeToday at 8:17 PM
	yeah
	but I don't have to chunkload all of them, right?
	only the 17x17 area

Barteks2xToday at 8:18 PM
	no, only the 17x17 ones
	and maybe the ones below
	also this is ITicket interface
	public interface ITicket {

		/**
		 * Weather or not a cube with this ticket should tick.
		 * (should blocks update, entities move around, and furnaces cook?)
		 *
		 * @return should cubes with this ticket tick
		 */
		boolean shouldTick();
	}

	good. so I start with generating 19x19x4 and populating 17x17x2.
	and every time I start a new layer, I generate another 19x19 and then populate another 17x17

	that's all you have to implement, and then add that object to each cube you want to chunkload
	that should do it
	you will need to dpend on cubicchunks itself instead of just the api to do that
	the API may expose a different chunkloading API
